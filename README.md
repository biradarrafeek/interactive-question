# HTML Structure:

    The HTML structure includes three question cards and a title screen.
    Each card has a question, an input field for the answer, and a "Next" button.

# CSS Styling:

    Basic styles for the body, cards, inputs, and buttons to make the page look neat and responsive.
    The media query ensures the cards are full-width on smaller screens.

# JavaScript Functionality:

    The script checks if the questions have been answered before by checking the local storage. If yes, it directly shows the title screen.
    The nextQuestion function validates the input, stores the answer in the local storage, and displays the next question or the title screen accordingly.
    The showTitleScreen function hides the question container and shows the title screen.
